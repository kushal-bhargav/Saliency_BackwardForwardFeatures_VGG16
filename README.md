These codes here are revised version of the top-down saliency part of the work "Saliency Detection by Forward and Backward Cues in Deep-CNN,  IEEE ICIP 2017", which can be accessed from [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00152). 

The saliency computation code here can be run just CPU without the need of GPU; however, it is also tested by Nvidia GTX 970 GPU with Nvidia Driver 375.82 and Cuda-8.0 on Ubuntu 14 LTS environment. Chainer 1.21.0 version is used as the deep learning tool for this application. 

### Before running the code:

* please change the line 24 for "imagefolder" directory variable in main_Saliency.py file for the images that you want to test.

* the results will be saved to same path with the main_Saliency.py. So, if you want to save the results to specific existing directory, please chage the line 25 for "resultfolder" directory variable in main_Saliency.py file for the images that you want to test.

* Pretrained VGG16 chainer model can be obtained through the git [chainer-imagenet-vgg repository of Shunta Saito](https://github.com/mitmul/chainer-imagenet-vgg) under download_chainermodel.sh.
     which links the VGG16 model [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oubwxgmqzep24yq/VGG.model?dl=0)
     or 
     ```
     $ wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/oubwxgmqzep24yq/VGG.model?dl=0 -O VGG.model
     ```
* if you want to check saliency without center bias, just remove the "mask" variable multiplication in line 131      

## Run the code:

```
$ python main_Saliency.py
```
